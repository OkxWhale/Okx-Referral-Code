## OKX Security Measures

Security is a top priority for OKX, and the platform uses a combination of technologies and practices to keep user funds safe:

- **Cold Storage**: The majority of user funds are stored in offline cold wallets, making it harder for hackers to access them.
- **Multi-Signature Authentication**: To ensure withdrawals are secure, OKX uses multi-signature authentication for all withdrawals, meaning more than one key is required to approve a transaction.

OKX offers competitive trading fees across its platform. The fee structure is designed to reward active traders with lower costs:

- **Futures Trading Fees**: OKX charges a flat 0.03% maker fee and a 0.05% taker fee for futures contracts, which is highly competitive compared to other exchanges.
- **Margin Trading Fees**: Margin fees vary depending on the asset being traded, but the exchange provides low-interest rates for borrowing.

In addition, users can save even more on fees by participating in the OKX **VIP Program**, which rewards high-volume traders with lower fees and priority customer support.
